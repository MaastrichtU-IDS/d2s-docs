This documentation provides straightforward guidelines to integrate and access data in a RDF knowledge graph.

* Integrate any structured data using various solutions.
* Deploy various interfaces to consume the Knowledge Graph data.
* Deploy user-friendly web UI to access the integrated data.

The documented method allow to quickly publish structured data complying with the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable).

## Create a repository

First step is to create a repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com). This will allow you to keep track of the changes to your scripts and mappings using `git`.

* Add a `README.md` file with basic informations about your project: description, how to run it, etc.
* Add a `LICENSE` file with the license information (e.g. MIT license)
* Follow a consistent pattern to store your mapping files and scripts.
