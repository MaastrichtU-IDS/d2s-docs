After the RDF Knowledge Graph has been generated and loaded in a triplestore, [HCLS dataset descriptive statistics](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/) can be easily generated and published for the published dataset. 

Checkout the `fair-metadata` Python library to generate HCLS metadata for a SPARQL endpoint: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/fair-metadata

Automate it by adding a GitHub Action to your workflow.
