## For preprocessing

Python is a good solution to perform preprocessing on the data for tasks not supported by RML. 

## For RDF conversion

You can also perform the conversion to RDF using the `rdflib` library. You can access the `rdflib` documentation [here](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

* We recommend to use `pandas` to handle tabular files as dataframes efficiently.
* You can easily map any structured data (CSV, TSV, XLSX, SPSS, SQL, XML, JSON, YAML) to RDF using Python and `rdflib`.
