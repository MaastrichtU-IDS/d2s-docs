## Use the RDF Mapping Language


Use the [RDF Mapping Language (RML)](https://rml.io/) to map your structured data (CSV, TSV, XLSX, SPSS, SQL, XML, JSON, YAML) to RDF using a declarative mapping language. 

We recommend to use [YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/), a mapping language to replace the RDF by YAML, to make the definition of RML mappings easier.

The **[Matey Web UI editor ü¶ú](https://rml.io/yarrrml/matey/#edit)** is available to easily write and test RML mappings in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files using the [YARRRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/) simplified mapping language. The mappings can be conveniently tested in the browser on a sample of the file to transform.

* RML Specifications can be found as a [W3C unofficial draft](https://rml.io/specs/rml/).

* See the [rml.io](https://rml.io/) website for more documentation about RML and the various tools built and deployed by Ghent University.

:::info YARRRML package

YARRRML can also be parsed locally or automatically using a `npm` package:

```shell
npm i @rmlio/yarrrml-parser -g
```

::::

Example  of a YARRRML mapping file using the commonly needed [split function](https://rml.io/docs/rmlmapper/default-functions/#split):

```yaml
prefixes:
  grel: "http://users.ugent.be/~bjdmeest/function/grel.ttl#"
  rdfs: "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  gn: "http://www.geonames.org/ontology#"
mappings:
  neighbours:
    sources:
      - ['/mnt/workspace/input/geonames/dataset-geonames-countryInfo.csv~csv']
    s: http://www.geonames.org/ontology#$(ISO)
    po:
      - [a, gn:Country]
      - p: gn:neighbours
        o:
            function: grel:string_split
            parameters:
                - [grel:valueParameter, $(neighbours)]
                - [grel:p_string_sep, "\|"]
            language: en
```

* `grel:p_string_sep` separators needs to be escaped with `\`
* See the [full list of available default functions](https://rml.io/docs/rmlmapper/default-functions/).
* Additional function can be added by integrating them in a `.jar` file, see the [documentation](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java#including-functions).

You can also generate nquads by adding the graph infos in the `rr:subjectMap` in RML mappings:

```turtle
rr:graphMap [ rr:constant <https://w3id.org/trek/graph/drugbank> ];
```

### Convert with RMLMapper

The [rmlmapper-java](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/) execute RML mappings to generate RDF Knowledge Graphs.

:::warning Not for large files

The RML Mapper loads all data in memory, so be aware when working with big datasets. 

:::

```bash
java -jar rmlmapper.jar -m mapping.ttl -o rdf-output.nt
```

### Run on RMLStreamer on DSRI

The [RMLStreamer](/docs/services-utilities#rmlstreamer) is a scalable implementation of the [RDF Mapping Language Specifications](https://rml.io/specs/rml/) to generate RDF out of structured input data streams.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The RMLStreamer is still in development, some features such as functions are yet to be implemented.

It can be run on the **[Data Science Research Infrastructure](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/)** OpenShift cluster.

* See the [DSRI documentation](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/docs/deploy-services#apache-flink) to deploy Apache Flink.

* Copy the RMLStreamer.jar file, your mapping files and data files to the pod. It will be proposed when running `d2s rml` but they could be loaded manually before. 

```shell
# get flink pod id
oc get pod --selector app=flink --selector component=jobmanager --no-headers -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name

oc exec <flink-jobmanager-id> -- mkdir -p /mnt/workspace/import
oc rsync workspace/input <flink-jobmanager-id>:/mnt/workspace/
oc rsync datasets <flink-jobmanager-id>:/mnt/
```

* Transferring the files to the Apache Flink storage easily is still a work in progress. Use `oc cp` if `rsync` does not work.

* The progress of the job can be checked in the Apache Flink web UI.

* Output file in `/mnt/rdf_output-associations-mapping.nt` in the pod

* Or in `/apache-flink` in the persistent storage.
