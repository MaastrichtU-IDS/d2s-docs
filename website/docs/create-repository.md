title: Create a repository
---

Create a repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com), and keep track of the changes to your scripts and mappings using `git`.

* Add a `README.md` file with basic informations about your project: description, how to run it, etc.
* Add a `LICENSE` file with the license information (e.g. MIT license)
* Follow a consistent pattern to store your mapping files and scripts.
