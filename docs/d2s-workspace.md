## Initialize the project

Ideally you should **create a new repository from the template [d2s-transform-template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template) repository**, and provide this repository URL when asked by `d2s init`.

In this example I will directly use the default [d2s-transform-template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template) repository.

> All `d2s` commands are designed to be run from this directory.

For licensing reason the GraphDB triplestore free edition needs to be [downloaded manually](https://ontotext.com/products/graphdb/ ). Download the `.zip` standalone distribution version `9.1.1` before `d2s init`

Now initialize your project ðŸŽ¬

```shell
d2s init my-project-folder-name
```

> Follow the instructions to initialize your project.

> Your project settings are stored in `.d2sconfig`

## Change directory

All `d2s` commands are designed to be **run from the project root folder**. Once your project initiated, change directory to go in your project folder (where the git repository has been cloned)

```shell
cd my-project-folder-name
```

---

## Pull Docker images

`d2s init` should pull and build all Docker images used by `d2s`, it can also be done manually.

```shell
d2s update
```
