Integrating data has never been effortless, this framework aims to make it easier by bringing together commonly accepted standards and modern scalable technologies.

Here is described everything you will need to do, in practice, to build a Knowledge Graph out of your data.

We provide a [GitHub template repository](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template/) to run example workflows and start building your own pipelines.

## Designed to build scalable Knowledge Graphs

### The Data2Services philosophy

One task, one container, few parameters (e.g. input file path, SPARQL endpoint, credentials, mapping file path)

- **Pull** or build the Docker images.
- **Start required services** (e.g. [Apache Drill](https://github.com/amalic/apache-drill) and [GraphDB](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/graphdb)).
- **Execute the Docker modules** you want, providing the right parameters.

Modules can easily be integrated to most workflow engines. 

We support and provide examples for workflows described with [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) (for Linux/MacOS) and [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/) (for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster).

### Convert structured data to a target knowledge graph

Data2Services offers handy tools to **convert large amount of structured data**, such as relational databases, tabular files or XML files, **to RDF Knowledge Graphs**. 

Converting data with Data2Services relies on 3 steps:

* A **generic RDF** is automatically generated from the input data structure.
* [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) queries are designed by the user to **map** the generic RDF **to a target model**. 
* Extra modules can be added to the workflow to perform operations SPARQL doesn't natively support 
  * E.g. splitting statements, resolving the preferred URI for an entity.

The [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) modules required for the transformation are run in a workflow using a workflow orchestration tool. We provide support for [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/) and [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) workflows. This makes the transformation easily reproducible, and enables you to run the transformation on new data without effort.

It is strongly **recommended to use a POSIX system** (Linux, MacOS) if you consider running workflows on your laptop, since most workflow orchestration tools do not support Windows. Additional documentation for Windows can be found [here](/docs/guide-windows).

## Project structure

The Data2Services client 

* [d2s-cli](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-cli): A Command Line Interface to orchestrate the integration of heterogenous  data and the deployment of services consuming the integrated data (Python).
* [d2s-transform-template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template): template to create a Data2Services project folder, with example mappings to a few datasets, it include [d2s-cwl-workflows](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-cwl-workflows) as submodule.
  * [d2s-cwl-workflows](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-cwl-workflows) (imported as submodule in [d2s-transform-template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template)): CWL workflows to transform structured data to a target RDF model.
* [d2s-documentation](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-documentation): this documentation website.

The [d2s client](https://pypi.org/manage/project/d2s/releases/) use the following directory structure, which can be found in the example project [d2s-transform-template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template).

Example of directory structure for the `drugbank` dataset.

## Choose a data model

**Choose** or build **a common data model** ([ontology](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology)) to represent your data *(10' to 10 weeks)*

* Try to reuse existing ontologies and concepts as much as possible.
* Combine concepts from different ontologies, or define new ones.

> Search for relevant existing models in ontology repositories, such as [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/recommender) for biomedical concepts or [AgroPortal](http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/recommender) for agronomy.

> You can use the [Protégé ontology editor](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to build your ontology.

> This task only needs to be **done once**, when starting to project. To define the data model the integrated datasets will comply to.

---

## Write the download script

Setup the source data to **download using Bash scripts** via [d2s-bash-exec](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-bash-exec) *(~10')*

> Most of the time, if the data is properly distributed, it should consist in a simple `wget -N` 

> We provide [a template](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-download/blob/master/datasets/TEMPLATE/download.sh) for common operations, such as extracting URLs from an HTML file, recursive download, uncompressing files, adding missing columns headers to tabular files...

---

## Automatically convert source data to generic RDF

Run [xml2rdf](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/xml2rdf) or [AutoR2RML](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/AutoR2RML) (tabular files, RDB) to **Automatically convert** source data to **generic RDF** *(~10')*

> Template SPARQL mapping queries are generated to help the users to start define the mappings

---

## Define the dataset metadata

Define the dataset [**HCLS metadata**](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/) *(~10')*

* [Summary metadata](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template/blob/master/datasets/drugbank/metadata/metadata-drugbank-0-summary.rq) need to be defined once for each dataset *(~10 fields to fill)*
* [Distribution metadata](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template/blob/master/datasets/drugbank/metadata/metadata-drugbank-1.rq) need to be defined for each new version *(~6 fields to fill)*

> Some metadata from the summary is retrieved for the distribution

> Much metadata fields don't need changes between versions

---

## Define the mappings

Define [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) mapping queries to **transform the generic RDF to the target data model** 

*(~20' for a tabular file, can be hours for a complex XML file)*

* Start from the previously generated templates if you don't have mappings for this kind of data.
* See examples to map [tabular files](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template/tree/master/datasets/cohd/mapping) or [XML files](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/d2s-transform-template/tree/master/datasets/drugbank/mapping).
* Be careful when iterating on multiple result arrays in SPARQL, it can blow up the processing time(for XML mapping). Always split your queries to never iterate over more than one array for a parent node.
  * E.g. if `drug:001` from a XML file has multiple `publications` and multiple `synonyms` nodes in its child, then it is preferable to get them in 2 different queries. Retrieving the 2 arrays in a single query would results in the returned row count be a cartesian product of the 2 arrays, which grows exponentially with the size of each array.
  * Final semantic results are the same, but the performance of the transformation is highly impacted.

>  Defining the mappings is the hardest and most cumbersome task in data integration. We are working actively on making it easier, by working on mapping automations and GUIs. 

---

## Run the workflow

Now that the mappings have been designed you are almost done.

* **Start your triplestore** (database for RDF Knowledge Graph), if it is not already running
* **Run the transformation**, using a workflow orchestration tool (such as [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) or [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/)).

> Define the **workflow YAML configuration file**: triplestore URL and credentials, path to mapping files, path to download script, URI of the final graph *(~10')*
